# A demographer who untangles the data—and drives action.
I bridge **research**, **public communication**, and **policy implementation** on Japan’s low fertility and family change.

  <a class="btn" href="{{ '/en/media-inquiries/' | relative_url }}">Media inquiries</a>
</div>

## Position
I challenge the old split: academics staying in the ivory tower vs communicators lacking rigour.
I aim to do both—**publishable research and practical implementation**—while communicating clearly to the public and media.

### Three pillars
- **Research** — Publications in *Demography* and *Social Forces*. General-audience book (Winter 2026).
- **Public communication** — Columns, note, YouTube/Podcast. Fact literacy for better debate.
- **Policy implementation** — Dashboards & communication manuals with local governments.

### Selected work
- City dashboard: “ideal number of children” — *common evidence base for policy design*  
- Communication manual & templates — *reduced misinterpretation in public materials*
