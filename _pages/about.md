Ryohei Mogi is a demographer who **bridges scientific research with real-world action**.  
My mission is to turn evidence into action to tackle low fertility, through research and collaboration with policymakers, the media, and both public and private sectors.**

---

#### Background
I received my Ph.D. in Demography from the Centre for Demographic Studies, Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona.  
I then worked as a Research Fellow at the Department of Sociology, University of Oxford, and as an Assistant Professor at the Interdisciplinary Centre on Population Dynamics, University of Southern Denmark.  
I am currently based at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona.  

My expertise lies in **comparative demographic research**, analysing fertility and family change.

#### How I work with partners
Alongside academic research, I actively engage with **policymakers, media, and the public and private sectors**.  
Here are the main ways I collaborate:

- **Advisory & consulting**: Supporting policymakers and organisations with evidence-based guidance. This includes survey design, analysis of fertility and marriage trends, and the creation of data dashboards
- **Public speaking & lectures**: Keynotes, seminars, and talks on fertility and population issues 
- **Writing & media**: Articles, commentary, and fact-checking for newspapers, magazines, and international media outlets
