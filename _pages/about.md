Ryohei Mogi is a demographer specialising in low fertility, family change, and their policy implications. Currently, I hold a Beatriu de Pin√≥s Fellowship at Pompeu Fabra University (Barcelona, Spain).

I help policymakers, journalists, and international organisations understand fertility decline and family change through evidence-based demographic research.

My research examines the drivers of fertility decline and the consequences of demographic change for societies. I have published in leading international journals (including Demography and Social Forces) and regularly present at global conferences.

I am open to collaborations with international organisations, policymakers, and journalists seeking clear, data-driven insights on fertility, family change, and population trends.

For inquiries about low fertility issues, changes in family life behaviours, or any other issues on demographic trends, collaboration opportunities, or interview requests, please feel free to contact me at `ryohei.mogi@upf.edu`.
